## 🌌 Overview

The **Nexus Mini-Trading-System** is a highly reactive, responsive, and performance-tuned frontend built. Our goal was to replicate the intensity and precision of real Wall Street trading terminals (like Bloomberg and Kraken Pro), while injecting a sleek, modern, cyberpunk-inspired UI.

### 🎨 The Glassmorphic Grid Architecture
Unlike standard web apps, this frontend utilizes a completely custom **CSS-driven cursor-tracking system**.
We bypassed native React `useState` tracking for background glows to eliminate render cycle lag. Instead, the UI reads directly from a React `useRef` and manipulates custom CSS variables (`--mouse-x`, `--mouse-y`) to power massive, full-screen transparent glowing grids—operating at a flawless 60 FPS under heavy chart loads without triggering a single React re-render.
